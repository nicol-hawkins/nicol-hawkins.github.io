                        <h1>Blog:<h2><em>My Kickstart Coding Journey has begun!</em></h2><h4>Oct. 27, 2019</h4></h1>
                        <p>A week ago I started my official coding journey at Kickstart Coding.<br>
                            The past few months I have been teaching myself to code via online tutorials.<br>
                            I've learned a lot from them, but I feel they can only take you so far.<br>
                            Just one week in and I feel like having the guidance of an instructor has <br>
                            helped me really understand concepts I only had vague notions of before.<br>
                            Being able to apply these concepts to build something of your own<br>
                            is super rewarding. This is my first website I've ever built, and I<br>
                            I'm proud of it! At first I tried to use a template, but decided there was<br>
                            too much noise and wanted to try from scratch. </p>
        
                            <h2><em>What's the deal with Webpage Responsiveness?</em><h3>Oct. 29, 2019</h3></h2>
                            <p>You know what really grinds my gears? Figuring out how to make my<br>
                            webpage responsive! I've tried a few different approaches, combed through<br>
                            stack overflow etc.. But still can't seem to get it right. This is the longest<br>
                            I've ever spent on an html problem with no results, so I thought I would take a <br>
                            break from all that and write a rant about it. I hope I can figure it out soon,<br>
                            but it may be something I have to come back to later or after I've had some help.
